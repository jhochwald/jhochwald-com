Hi, my name is Joerg Hochwald a/k/a Josh. I work as a consultant and enterprise architect and help customers to achieve their digital transformation goals. I'm located in Frankfurt am Main, Germany.

Most of my projects are related to Microsoft Azure, Microsoft 365 (Office 365), PowerShell, automation, and unified communication & collaboration. Since a while, my focus is Microsoft Teams and everything that is related to it.

I build a lot of PowerShell and Python based tools, script and Module to automate all the things. I love Open Source, so many of them are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jhochwald?tab=repositories). Feedback is appreciated.

In my [Blog](https://hochwald.net) I write about DevOps, all things PowerShell and many more topics. There you will also find my [Privacy Policy](https://hochwald.net/privacy-policy/) and [Impress](https://hochwald.net/impress/).

Feel free to get in touch with me!
